Deck Goes West - Rules
=============

Overview
--------

Set in the early settlement of the Americas, each player competes, either against other players or against the clock, to go as far west as possible, managing their supplies, exhaustion and injuries, all while staying safe from Bandits.

Each player maintains a deck of cards with various actions available.
During the main phase of the game players take turns to play cards and perform the actions on those cards. They may also buy cards from the trade row to gain extra abilities.
Once all players have passed, the bandits will take their turn, and the trade row will upate.

Then each player draws back up to 6 cards, and the cycle begins again.

Competetive, Co-op and Single player
---------------------

This game can be played competively, co-op and single player. The rules barely need adjustment. Simply choose the appropriate score board and everything falls into place.

The only differences from the competative game are as follows.

In Co-op all players use the same score counter, and win or lose together.

In Single Player, you do not have to wait for other players to take their turns, or pass the "Player 1" token.

Winning and Scoring
-------------------

The game is won by scoring a number of points by performing actions on the map. 

1. Reveal a Land Tile 
    - If that tile is furthest west 2vp
    - Otherwise 1vp
2. Build a Railway track
    - If that Track is the furthest west 3vp
    - Otherwise 2vp
3. Remove the last bandit from an area.
    - 2vp

The first player to reach the end of the score track wins the game.

If the Bandits reach the end of their track, the game ends immediately.
* In Co-op or Single player: The players Lose.
* In Competetive: The player with the most points wins.

    *(Ties are broken by distance west, followed by resource count)*

### Board Setup


Use the following diagram to help you follow setup instructions

<img src="{{cat $0 "/rules/start_setup_embedded.svg" }}">

1. **Choose and Place Board:** Choose a direction to represent West on the table. Take the appropriate Score Board (Standard or Co-op) And place it close to the the east of the playing area.It's compas should show the directions intended, and there should be plenty of room to expand to the West.

2. Add a **score counter** for every player to the clear '0' on the *Score Board*.

3. Add a **Bandit Token** to the red '0' on the *Score Board*

4. Shuffle the **Trade Row** cards and deal 5 of them across the top of the Score Board. Leaving the rest in a draw pile beside them.

5. Shuffle the **Pain** and **Exhaustion** Cards separately and place them face down by the appropriate symbol on the score board. These will help you tell the piles apart as they have no markings on the back.

6. Shuffle the **Land Tiles** and deal 6 of them face up in a 2x3 grid. North to south should be 3 tiles.

7. Add a **Player Counter** for each player to the Eastmost Central tile. If that tile is water, swap it with another tile. 

8. Deal 3 more *Land Tiles*, face down, to the west of the tiles already placed.

9. Make sure to leave space to grow. As you move west more cards will be added here.

### Player Setup 

<img src="{{cat $0 "/rules/player_setup.svg"}}">

1. Give each player a *Player Card* of the agreed **Difficulty**. (If this is your first game, choose 1).

2. Each player takes the **Resources** listed on the back of the *Player Card*

3. Each player takes the *Starter cards* listed on the back of the *Player Card*, shuffles them, and places them face down as their **Draw Pile** (It may be easier to sort the starter cards by name first)

4. Leave a space beside the *Player Card* for the **Discard Pile**. This is where you will put cards when you have used them.

5. Give 1 player the P1 Marker.


Order of Play 
-----------

Repeat *Player Phase* and then *Bandit Phase* until either a player, or the bandits reach the end of their score track.

### Player Phase

1. Draw Cards

    All players draw cards from their own personal deck until they have Cards in hand matching their hand size. (If they have more they do not have to discard)

2. Untap Player Card

    All players turn the Player Card to face forward

3. Pass the P1 Token *(In Solo Games ignore this)*

    The player who has the P1 Token passes it to the left.

4. Play and Buy Cards

    Starting with the player with the P1 Token, going clockwise. Players take turns to do one of the following actions.

    These actions are explained in more detail later.

    * Perform a Job
    * Purchase a Card
    * Trade with othe players
    * Pass 

    Once a player has passed, they may not do any more until the end of the round (Unless they are caught in a battle)
*(In Solo Games, just do actions the until you don't want to)*

5. May discard Item cards.

    Players may discard as many Item cards as they wish. They may not discard any Pain or Exhaustion cards at this point.

### Bandit Phase

*(This is shown on the back of Player Cards)*

1. Move the Bandit Tracker

    One space on the score board.

2. Move the Trade Row

    1. Place the rightmost *Trade Row* card in the Trade row discard pile.
    2. Move all cards in the *Trade Row* 1 space right.
    3. Draw a Card from the draw pile and add it to the leftmost space on the *Trade Row*.

3. Everyone takes an Exhaustion Card.

    From the 'E' stack of Danger cards, draw, and give each player 1 card to place on the top of their Discard Pile *(Or Draw pile if they prefer)*

4. Bandits Attack
    
    Starting From West to East, Each Group of bandits on the same tile as a player Attack (See "Attacking")

5. Bandits Move.
    Starting from West, then North, For every group of bandits not in on the same tile as a player, roll the Compas Dice.
    Move the bandits 1 Space in the direction indicated. Or if you roll a '+' Add one Bandit to the group
    * Bandits may move onto tiles that have been placed but not revealed, but not onto places with no tile at all.
    * If they cannot move North or South, move them West instead.
    * If they cannot move West, add a Bandit.
    * If a group has 6 or more bandits do not add another.
    * If a group of bandits meets another group, that have not rolled yet, move the other group separately. If they do not separate, they become 1 bigger group.

6. Remove Tiles.

    Remove all tiles more than 5 complete spaces East of the Eastmost player, along with any Bandits on them.
    (This step is not strictly necessary, but those bandits are unlikely to affect the game any more).

7. Bandits Appear.

    Roll the chosen *Bandit Dice*, as many times as are indicated in the red star in the same section as the furthest forward player or bandit tracker on the scoreboard.
    For each roll, add 1 bandit to every tile with the same number in it's red star on the map.


Understanding Jobs
------------------

A key concept in this game is the Jobs. There are Jobs on all game Cards.  They are a list of symbols representing actions that must all be taken in order to perform any of them and should be done in order from left to right.

Every Card has Jobs on, to use it's job you
