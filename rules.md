Deck Goes West - Rules
=============

Overview
--------

Set in the early settlement of the Americas, each player competes, either against other players or against the clock, to go as far west as possible, managing their supplies, exhaustion and injuries, all while staying safe from Bandits.

Each player maintains a deck of cards with various actions available.
During the main phase of the game players take turns to play cards and perform the actions on those cards. They may also buy cards from the trade row to gain extra abilities.
Once all players have passed, the bandits will take their turn, and the trade row will upate.

Then each player draws back up to 6 cards, and the cycle begins again.

Competitive, Co-op and Single player
---------------------

This game can be played competively, co-op and single player. The rules barely need adjustment. Simply choose the appropriate score board and everything almost falls into place.

For the sake of simplicity, these rules are written for competetive play.
The changes needed for cooperative and solo play are found in the Variants section at the back.

Winning and Scoring
-------------------

The game is won by reaching the end of the score track first. Players score points by performing actions on the map. 

1. Reveal a Land Tile 
    - If that tile is furthest west 2vp
    - Otherwise 1vp
2. Build a Railway track
    - If that Track is the furthest west 3vp
    - Otherwise 2vp
3. Remove the last bandit from an area.
    - 2vp

The first player to reach the end of the score track wins the game.

If the Bandits reach the end of their track, the game ends immediately.
* In Single Player: The player Loses.
* In Co-op: The players Lose.
* In Competitive: The player with the most points wins.

    *(Ties are broken by distance west, followed by resource count)*

Setup
-----

First Separate the cards into 4 groups based on their top right corner:

* Yellow Star = Starter Cards
* Black Star 'P' = *Pain* Cards
* Black Star 'E' = *Exhaustion* Cards
* Anything Else = *Trade Row* cards

<img src="{{cat $0 "/rules/card_types.svg"}}" >

Note : Pain and Exhaustion are both types of "Danger Card" if your hand becomes full of either, you lose. 



### Board Setup

Use the following diagram to help you follow setup instructions

<img src="{{cat $0 "/rules/start_setup_embedded.svg" }}">

1. **Choose and Place Board:** Choose a direction to represent West on the table. Take the appropriate Score Board (Standard or Co-op) And place it close to the east of the playing area.It's compass should show the directions intended, and there should be plenty of room to expand to the West.

2. Add a **Meeple** for every player to the clear '0' on the *Score Board*.

3. Add a **Bandit** to the red '0' on the *Score Board*, this will be the Bandit Tracker

4. Shuffle the **Trade Row** cards and deal 5 of them across the top of the Score Board. Leaving the rest in a draw pile beside them.

5. Shuffle the **Pain** and **Exhaustion** Cards separately and place them face down by the appropriate symbol on the score board. These will help you tell the piles apart as they have no markings on the back.

6. Shuffle the **Land Tiles** and deal 6 of them face up in a 2x3 grid. North to south should be 3 tiles.

7. Add a **Player Counter** for each player to the Eastmost Central tile. If that tile is water, swap it with another tile. 

8. Deal 3 more *Land Tiles*, face down, to the west of the tiles already placed.

9. Make sure to leave space to grow. As you move west more cards will be added here.

### Player Setup 

<img src="{{cat $0 "/rules/player_setup.svg"}}">

1. Give each player a *Player Card* of the agreed **Difficulty**. (If this is your first game, choose 1).

2. Each player takes the **Resources** listed on the back of the *Player Card*

3. Each player takes the *Starter cards* listed on the back of the *Player Card*, shuffles them, and places them face down as their **Draw Pile** (It may be easier to sort the starter cards by name first)

4. Leave a space beside the *Player Card* for the **Discard Pile**. This is where you will put cards when you have used them.

5. Give 1 player the P1 Marker.


Order of Play 
-----------

Repeat *Player Phase* and then *Bandit Phase* until either a player, or the bandits reach the end of their score track.

A complete *Player Phase* and *Bandit Phase* is called a **Round**.

### Player Phase

1. Draw Cards

    All players draw cards from their own personal deck until they have Cards in hand matching their hand size. (If they have more they do not have to discard)

    Whenever a Player needs to draw cards but his Draw Pile is empty, They shuffle their Discard Pile and it becomes their new Draw Deck. If the Discard pile is also empty, they do not draw any more.

2. Untap Player Card

    All players turn the Player Card to face forward

3. Pass the P1 Token *(In Solo Games ignore this)*

    The player who has the P1 Token passes it to the left.

4. Play and Buy Cards

    Starting with the player with the P1 Token, going clockwise until all players have passed, Players take turns to do one of the following actions.

    These actions are explained in more detail later.

    * Perform a Job
    * Purchase a Card
    * Trade with othe players
    * Attack Bandits 
    * Pass 

    Once a player has passed, they may not do any more until the end of the round (Unless they are caught in a battle)
*(In Solo Games, just do actions the until you don't want to)*

5. May discard Item cards.

    Players may discard as many Item cards as they wish. They may not discard any Pain or Exhaustion cards at this point.

### Bandit Phase

*(This is shown on the back of Player Cards)*

1. Move the Bandit Tracker

    One space on the score board.

2. Move the Trade Row

    1. Place the rightmost *Trade Row* card in the Trade row discard pile.
    2. Move all cards in the *Trade Row* 1 space right.
    3. Draw a Card from the draw pile and add it to the leftmost space on the *Trade Row*.

3. Everyone takes an Exhaustion Card.

    From the 'E' stack of Danger cards, draw, and give each player 1 card to place on the top of their Discard Pile *(Or Draw pile if they prefer)*

4. Bandits Attack
    
    Starting From West to East, Each Group of bandits on the same tile as a player Attack (See "Attacking")

5. Bandits Move.
    Starting from West, then North, For every group of bandits not in on the same tile as a player, roll the Compas Dice.
    Move the bandits 1 Space in the direction indicated. Or if you roll a '+' Add one Bandit to the group
    * Bandits may move onto tiles that have been placed but not revealed, but not onto places with no tile at all.
    * If they cannot move North or South, move them West instead.
    * If they cannot move West, add a Bandit.
    * If a group has 6 or more bandits do not add another.
    * If a group of bandits meets another group, that have not rolled yet, move the other group separately. If they do not separate, they become 1 bigger group.

6. Remove Tiles.

    Remove all tiles more than 5 complete spaces East of the Eastmost player, along with any Bandits on them.
    (This step is not strictly necessary, but those bandits are unlikely to affect the game any more).

7. Bandits Appear.

    Roll the chosen *Bandit Dice*, as many times as are indicated in the red star in the same section as the furthest forward player or bandit tracker on the scoreboard.
    For each roll, add 1 bandit to every tile with the same number in it's red star on the map.


Perform a Job
------------------

A Job is a set of Actions that must ALL be performed, they are indicated by a set of Icons in a row. For example.

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/job_examples.svg">

Jobs are found in 4 places.

* On Item Cards (Starter and Trade)

    To perform a Job on an Item Card, you must discard that card.
    You may only perform one job per card.

* On Danger Cards (Pain and Exhaustion)

    The reason to perform the Job on a Danger Card, is to get rid of it. Danger Cards may not be discarded like Item Cards, and so you have to use the last action of their Jobs to either Discard them or Scrap them.

    *(Note : Scrapping is much better as Discarding them means they will come into your hand again, Scrapping them means they are gone for good.)*

* On Player Cards

    To use a Job on a *Player Card* you must Tap that *Player Card*. That is rotate it by 90 degrees, to mark it as used. You may only use one job on a player card per round.  It will be Untapped again, at the start of each Round.

* On Village Tiles

    You may only use a Village's Job once per visit. To use it, your Meeple must be on that tile and standing up. Lay the Meeple down, and then do it's action.
    When you move out of that Village, stand your Meeple up again.

    **You cannot use a Village's job while there are Bandits on the tile**

If multiple jobs provide the same last action, you may use them in the same turn. Even if one of those jobs is a Card and the other on a Village or Player Card.

Understanding the Job Icons
----------------

### Places

Square Icons represent a place. Your Meeple must be in that kind of place to perform the action. There must also be **No Bandits on the tile**

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/places.svg">

### Resources

There are 4 key resources in the game, "Gold", "Iron", "Wood" and "Food". They can be paid and gained, to and from the General supply.

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/resources.svg">

'n' On the card will be an actual number.

The grey circles represent a group of 'n' of the same item.
If there are more than one grey circle, the contents of the each circle does not have to be the same.

### ⬢ Rolling Dice ⬢

The ⬢ Symbol means Roll Dice. The dice that come with this game have 6 sides, and the numbers [0,0,1,1,1,2] on representing successes.

If using standard D6, treat 3,4,5 as 1 Success, and 6 as 2 Successes.

If told ```+n⬢``` Roll 'n' dice and gain 1 of the resource for every success.

### 'x' Means Any Number

When Performing the Job If an action has an 'x' you can choose any number for x : Even Zero. It will be the same number for the whole Job.

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/x_is_any.svg">

### Card Acions

There are four actions that involve Cards

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/card_actions.svg">

When Scrapping a Card put it in the appropriate discard pile. eg 'E' Danger cards beside the 'E' Danger draw pile, Starter Cards are removed from the game.

Gained Cards can be added to top of your Draw Pile or Discard Pile

### Card Types

The four *Card Actions* can be applied to different types of cards. So the Card image will change to match the type.

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/card_action_types.svg">

When the card is "This card", the symbol will also match the color of the card to help you remember that it refers to the card you are looking at.

**You cannot discard a Danger Card when the action requires an Item Card Or Visa Versa**

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/card_action_examples.svg">

### Special Actions

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/build_railway.svg">

* Build Railway
    * Place an Railway (Iron) Token on the Tile you are currently on.
    * Cannot be done if there is already a Railway Token Down.
    * If this is the most West Railway yet, score 3 VP.
    * Otherwise score 2 VP

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/reveal.svg">

* Reveal Land
    * Reveal 'n' tiles within 2 spaces from your current position. 
    * One diagonal is allowed.
    * You may choose places without a tile, add one and reveal it.

### Movement

There are three kinds of movement actions.

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/movement_types.svg">

These actions mean move your player 'n' spaces on the map orthagonaly (that is NWES) not diagonally. Though they have different limitations.

* Normal Movement
    * Cannot move onto water.
    * Can move off of water.
    * Moving onto a mountain counts as moving two spaces.
    * Moving onto a tile with a railway does not cost movement points, but you must have at least 1 *Normal Movement* left to use it.
* Climbing Movement
    * Cannot move onto water
    * Can move off of water
    * Mountains Cost 1 movement.
    * Even tiles with railway cost 1 Movement
* Sailing Movement
    * Must move either from or onto water or river.
    * Moving onto a mountain costs 2 Spaces.
    * Tiles with railway cost 1 Movement.
    
You may play multiple movement Jobs in the same turn and combine movement types in the same turn.

*(Reminder : You may only play 1 Job per card)*

You may use any movement type to try to move onto unrevealed land.

If you do not have enough movement to achieve it, you have the choice to either play another Job for the required movement, or not move there. Either way you score the VP for revealing it.

You do not have to move onto revealed land, however that still costs you 1 Distance of your movement (Any type). You may still use remaining movement to try another direction.

Revealing a tile by movement commits you to the chosen direction. You may not go in another direction that turn, without stepping onto the revealed tile.

If you step onto a tile which is not yet revealed, reveal it. (See *Revealing Tiles)

If you step onto a space without a tile, add a tile, and then reveal it.

Bandits
-------

While travelling you are going to face bandits who will hinder your journey.They are represented by Bandit Counters, and Triple Bandit Counters.

When you reveal a Bandit Campfire, and during the Bandits Appear Phase, bandits will arrive on the map. They will mostly be travelling west, and if they meet you will attack you. You may attack them on your turn as well if you have the weapons to do it.

All Bandits on a tile are considered a group, and move and attack together.

### Attacking

Attacks work the same way whether Players or Bandits are attacking.
* Bandits have 1⬢ attack and 1⬢ defence for every bandit on the tile.
* Bandits take 'n' Damage by removing 'n' Bandits from the board.
* Players take 'n' damage by **all players** on the tile taking 'n' Pain cards each into their discard pile.

The order of a battle.

1. All players on the tile choose jobs they wish to activate, and pay their cost (But do not roll Attack or Defence with dice requirements yet)

Primary attack

2. The Attackers roll their attack for *hits*
3. Defenders their defence for *saves*
4. Defenders take 1 damage for every hit above saves.

Counter attack

5. Defenders roll their attack for *hits*
6. Attackers roll their defence for *saves*
7. Attackers take 1 damage for every hit above saves.

### Bandits Move

Starting with the Westmost (then Northmost) Group, for each group of bandits, Roll the Compas Dice, and Move them in the Direction Indicated *(N = North,W = West,S = South)*.
* If the dice lands on '+' and the group has fewer than 6 members, Add a Bandit to the group. *(If Bandit groups merge to more than 6, that is fine.)*
* If the group lands on a group that hasn't yet moved, move that group next. If the second group does not move, the two groups merge to become one larger group.
* Bandits may move onto unrevealed tiles, but not onto spaces without a tile.
* If the Bandits should move North or South but cannot, move them West.
* If the Bandits should move West but cannot, Add a Bandit (if less than 6)

### Bandits Appear

The red stars on the *Score Board* have a number in them. That number is how many times to roll the *Bandit Dice*. 

Choose the Star in the section with the furthest forward Meeple, or Bandit Tracker. 

Roll the Bandit Dice, that many times, and add a bandit to all tiles with the rolled number in the red star on the tile.

*The numbers on the tiles go from 1 to 8, so the d8 is the most likely to add bandits making the game harder*

Revealing Tiles
---------------

A key goal in Deck Goes West is to discover new land, ie reveal tiles. This is either done by the Reveal Action using Telescopes/Binoculars

To reveal a tile, flip it so that it faces up.
* If it is the furthest West tile revealed, score 2 Points
* Otherwise Score 1 VP
* If it has a Campfire add Bandits to it. The number of bandits is the one in the Red star on the scoreboard in the section with the Furthest Player or Bandit Tracker.

Once you have revealed the tile, add face down tiles to empty spaces around it.
* If the tile is on the center row (going West), to all empty spaces next to it.
* If the tile is North of the center row, to those South, West, and East.
* If the tile is South of the center row, to those North, West, and East.

** Note Adding these is important because bandits can step onto unrevealed tiles, but not empty spaces**


## Cooperation Bonus

When a player performs a job that's last action produces a Dice amount of a certain resource, if there are other players on the tile, he may invite them to join him.

The other players may then activate any of their jobs that also produce the same resource by dice, paying their appropriate cost.

All players then roll. All players then gain the full amount they rolled, plus half of the amount the other players rolled, added together and rounded up.

## Trade

When to players are on the same tile they may trade. The player who's turn it is offers the trade, and if it is agreed, that player discards a card and proceeds with the trade.

* Item Cards are traded from one players hand to the top of the other player's Draw or Discard pile.
* Resources are traded directly.
* Danger cards cannot be traded

# Variants

## Precious Cargo 

In Precious Cargo players must bring a wagon with a precious macguffin West with them.

### Setup Changes -- Co op

* Choose a "Precious Cargo - Co op" Board
* Add the *Wagon Piece* to the same tile as the players.
* Add only 1 counter to the players score track as players score together.

### Setup Changes -- Competitive

* Choose a "Competetive" Board
* Add the *Wagon Piece* to the same tile as the players.

### Rules Changes

Players no longer score by revealing tiles.
Players score by:

* Removing Bandits : 2vp
* Building Railway : 2vp or 3vp)
* Moving the Wagon West : 2vp (-2vp for moving it East)

To move the wagon, a player must be on the same tile as the wagon and use a movement action to move the wagon **instead** of themselves. (The Wagon follows the same movement rules they would)



### Extra Rules

Players no longer score by revealing tiles.
Players score by:

* Removing Bandits : 2vp
* Building Railway : 2vp or 3vp)
* Moving the Wagon West : 2vp (-2vp for moving it East)

The Wagon may be attacked by bandits. If the Wagon would take any Damage, move the bandit tracker one space forward, no matter how big the damage.

To move the wagon, a player must be on the same tile as the wagon and use a movement action to move the wagon **instead** of themselves. (The Wagon follows the same movement rules as players)
