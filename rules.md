Deck Goes West - Rules
=============

Overview
--------

Set in the early settlement of the Americas, each player competes, either against other players or against the clock, to go as far west as possible while maintaining their supplies and managing their supplies, exhaustion and injuries, all while staying safe from Bandits.

Each player maintains a deck of cards with various actions available.
During the main phase of the game players take turns to play cards and perform the actions on those cards. They may also buy cards from the trade row to gain extra abilities.
Once all players have passed, the bandits will take their turn, and the trade row will upate.

Then each player draws back up to 6 cards, and the cycle begins again.

Choose a direction to represent East on the table. Take the appropriate Score board (Solo or Multiplayer) And place it at the east so it's top is towards east.

Add a score counter for every player to the blue '0' on the Score board.

In solo games, also add a score counter for the bandits to the red '0' on the score board.

Give each player a Player Card. 
    * In a solo game, choose the starter card you wish, Higher level Player cards will make the game more difficult
    * In multiplayer, each player should have a level 1 card.

Sort the Starter cards by Name. Each Starter Card has a number in the yellow star, that is how many of that card each player should have. Distribute the cards like this. Each player should have 10 cards.
Each player should shuffle these 10 cards, this will be thier Draw Deck.

Sort the rest cards by their Type (Shown in contents) and shuffle each pile separately.
    * Place the Pain and Exhaustion cards face down by their star on the score board.
    * Place the Trade Row cards West of the Score Board, and deal the top 5 cards in a row these. All players will need to be able to see these clearly.

Choose a random Village Tile from the Land tiles and place that on the table West of the Trade Row, face up.

Shuffle the rest of the tiles and then deal and lay out 5 tiles, face up, around the first. North,South and West, but not East.

After that place 3 Tiles, face down, to the west of those tiles.

Place a player counter for each player on the initial Village Tile.

In a multiplayer game give one player the First Turn Marker.


Understanding Jobs
