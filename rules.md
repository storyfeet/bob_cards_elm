Deck Goes West - Rules
=============

Overview
--------

Set in the early settlement of the Americas, each player competes, either against other players or against the clock, to go as far west as possible, managing their supplies, exhaustion and injuries, all while staying safe from Bandits.

Each player maintains a deck of cards with various actions available.
During the main phase of the game players take turns to play cards and perform the actions on those cards. They may also buy cards from the trade row to gain extra abilities.
Once all players have passed, the bandits will take their turn, and the trade row will upate.

Then each player draws back up to 6 cards, and the cycle begins again.

Winning and Scoring
-------------------

The game is won by scoring a number of points by performing actions on the map.

1. Reveal a Land Tile 
    - If that tile is furthest west 2vp
    - Otherwise 1vp
2. Build a Railway track
    - If that Track is the furthest west 3vp
    - Otherwise 2vp
3. Remove the last bandit from an area.
    - 2vp

### Board Setup


Use the following diagram to help you follow setup instructions

<img src="{{cat $0 "/rules/start_setup_embedded.svg" }}">

1. **Choose and Place Board:** Choose a direction to represent West on the table. Take the appropriate Score Board (Standard or Co-op) And place it close to the the east of the playing area.It's compas should show the directions intended, and there should be plenty of room to expand to the West.

2. Add a **score counter** for every player to the clear '0' on the *Score Board*.

3. Add a **Bandit Token** to the red '0' on the *Score Board*

4. Shuffle the **Trade Row** cards and deal 5 of them across the top of the Score Board. Leaving the rest in a draw pile beside them.

5. Shuffle the **Pain** and **Exhaustion** Cards separately and place them face down by the appropriate symbol on the score board. These will help you tell the piles apart as they have no markings on the back.

6. Shuffle the **Land Tiles** and deal 6 of them face up in a 2x3 grid. North to south should be 3 tiles.

7. Add a **Player Counter** for each player to the Eastmost Central tile. If that tile is water, swap it with another tile. 

8. Deal 3 more *Land Tiles*, face down, to the west of the tiles already placed.

9. Make sure to leave space to grow. As you move west more cards will be added here.

### Player Setup 

<img src="{{cat $0 "/rules/player_setup.svg"}}">

1. Give each player a *Player Card* of the agreed **Difficulty**. (If this is your first game, choose 1).

2. Each player takes the **Resources** listed on the back of the *Player Card*

3. Each player takes the *Starter cards* listed on the back of the *Player Card*, shuffles them, and places them face down as their **Draw Pile** (It may be easier to sort the starter cards by name first)

4. Leave a space beside the *Player Card* for the **Discard Pile**. This is where you will put cards when you have used them.

5. Give 1 player the P1 Marker.


Order of Play 
-----------

Repeat *Player Phase* followed by *Bandit Phase* until Either a player, or a bandit reaches the end of their score track.

If the Bandits get their first, then in Co-op and Solo, The bandits win and player lose. In Multiplayer, the player furthest player on the score track wins. (Ties broken by distance west)

If a player gets their first, that player wins.

### Player Phase

1. Draw Cards

    All players draw cards from their own personal deck until they have Cards in hand matching their hand size. (If they have more they do not have to discard)

2. Untap Player Card

    All players turn the Player Card to face forward

3. Pass the P1 Token *(In Solo Games ignore this)*

    The player who has the P1 Token passes it to the left.

4. Play and Buy Cards

    Starting with the player with the P1 Token, going clockwise. Players take turns to do one of the following actions.

    These actions are explained in more detail later.

    * Perform a Job
    * Purchase a Card
    * Pass 

    Once a player has passed, they may not do any more until the end of the round (Unless they are caught in a battle)
*(In Solo Games, just do actions the until you don't want to)*

5. May discard Item cards.

    Players may discard as many Item cards as they wish. They may not discard any Pain or Exhaustion cards at this point.

### Bandit Phase

*(This is shown on the back of Player Cards)*




Understanding Jobs
------------------

A key concept in this game is the Jobs. There are Jobs on all game Cards.  They are a list of symbols representing actions that must all be taken in order to perform any of them and should be done in order from left to right.

Every Card has Jobs on, to use it's job you
