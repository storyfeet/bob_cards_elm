Deck Goes West - Rules
=============

Overview
--------

Set in the early settlement of the Americas, each player competes, either against other players or against the clock, to go as far west as possible while maintaining their supplies and managing their supplies, exhaustion and injuries, all while staying safe from Bandits.

Each player maintains a deck of cards with various actions available.
During the main phase of the game players take turns to play cards and perform the actions on those cards. They may also buy cards from the trade row to gain extra abilities.
Once all players have passed, the bandits will take their turn, and the trade row will upate.

Then each player draws back up to 6 cards, and the cycle begins again.

Winning and Scoring

The game is won by scoring a number of points by performing actions on the map.
