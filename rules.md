Deck Goes West - Rules
=============

Overview
--------

Set in the early settlement of the Americas, players may compete, or works together, to go as far west as possible. All while managing supplies, exhaustion and injuries, and staying safe from Bandits.

Each player maintains a deck of cards with various actions available.
During the day phase of the game players play cards to perform actions. They may also buy cards to gain abilities or perform their own character abilities.

Once all players have run out actions and passed, during the night the bandits will take their turn, and the trade row will upate.

Then each player draws cards, and the cycle begins again.

Winning and Scoring
-------------------

The game is won by reaching the end of the score track first. Players score points by performing actions on the map. 

The way you score points depends on the mission you are playing, but common ways are : 

1. Revealing Land Tiles
2. Building a Railway track
3. Removing bandits from an area
4. Moving Special pieces West

The first player to reach the end of the score track wins the game.

If the Bandits reach the end of their track, the game ends immediately, and the player with the most points wins.

*(Ties are broken by distance west, followed by resource count)*

Verses, Co-op and Single player
---------------------

This game can be played as Verses, as Co-op and as single player. The rules barely need adjustment. Simply choose the appropriate *Mission Card* and everything basically falls into place.

For Cooperative Play:

* Turn order is not important. Players may take their turns in any order they agree.
* All players share a single score counter, and as such, win or lose together.
* If any player dies, or the bandits reach the end of their track, the whole team lose.

For Solo Play:

* Turn order is not important.
* You may either play a Co-op campaign, managing two charaters or a VS game as one, aiming to beat the bandit tracker.

Contents
---------

* Score Boards * 4
* Mission Cards * 12
* Crib Sheets * 4
* Meeples * 10 (2 Per player)
* Wagon * 2
* Travel Bar * 1
* Bandit Counters - small * 20 , big * 20
* Resource Counters - Wood, Food, Iron , Gold : small * 20 Big * 10
* First Turn Marker
* Land Tiles * 48
* Player Cards * 12 (soon 18)
* Deck Cards 
* Dice
    * Bandit Dice * 4: d8-Hardest, d10, d12, d20-Easiest
    * Compass Dice * 1: Dice with faces [N, S, W, W , W , + ]
    * Job Dice * 10: Dice with faces [0,0,1,1,1,2]

Setup
-----

First Separate the cards into 4 groups based on their top right corner:

* Yellow Star = Starter Cards
* Black Star 'P' = *Pain* Cards
* Black Star 'E' = *Exhaustion* Cards
* Anything Else = *Trade Row* cards

<img src="{{cat $0 "/rules/card_types.svg"}}" >

Note : Pain and Exhaustion are both types of "Danger Card" if your hand becomes full of them, you lose. 

### Board Setup

Choose a *Mission Card* appropriate for your group.

* If this is your first Verses game, use "Discovery"
* If this is your first Co-op game use "Speed of the Slowest"

Mission Cards look something like this:

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/mission_cards.svg">

On the back you will find:
* a game setup diagram 
* Mission specific setup instructions
* A set of checkboxes. To mark difficulty levels as complete.

On the front you will find:
* A mode (Vs, Coop , Solo)
* Mission Specific rules
* Icons showing you how you score in this game.    
(These are explained in the text above them)

Follow the instructions below, and those on the back of your Mission Card (Which have extra instructions for some campaigns) to setup the play area.

Use the following diagram to help you follow setup instructions

<img src="{{$0}}/setups/basic_setup_numbered.svg">

1. **Choose and Place Board:** Choose a direction to represent West on the table. Choose a Score Board from the options on the Mission Card. And place it to the east of the playing area.It's compass should show the directions intended, and there should be plenty of room to expand to the West.

2. Add a **Meeple** for every player to the golden '0' horseshoe on the *Score Board*. (In Coop add just one counter which the players share)

3. Add a **Bandit** to the red '0' horseshoe the *Score Board*, this will be the Bandit Tracker

4. Shuffle the **Trade Row** cards and deal 5 of them across the top of the Score Board. Leaving the rest in a draw pile beside them, with a space beside it for discards.

5. Shuffle the **Pain** and **Exhaustion** Cards separately and place them face down by the appropriate symbol on the score board. These will help you tell the piles apart as they have no markings on the back.

6. Shuffle the **Land Tiles** and deal 6 of them face up in a 2x3 grid. North to south should be 3 tiles.    
(Make sure to leave room to grow. As you move west more cards will be added here.)

7. Deal 7 more *Land Tiles*, face down around them, to the North, West and South.

8. Add a **Meeple** for each player to the Eastmost Central tile.    
(Even if it's Water)

9. Place the rest of the *Land Tiles* face down in a draw pile by the board.

10. Place the *Mission Card* beside the *scoreboard*.

### Player Setup 

<img src="{{cat $0 "/rules/player_setup.svg"}}">

1. Give each player a *Player Card* of the agreed **Difficulty**. <img src="{{$0}}/jobs/difficulty.svg" width="25px" height="25px"> (If this is your first game, choose 1).

2. Each player takes the **Resources** listed on the back of the *Player Card*

3. Each player takes the *Starter cards* listed on the back of the *Player Card*, shuffles them, and places them face down as their **Draw Pile** (It may be easier to sort the starter cards by name first)

4. Leave a space beside the *Player Card* for the **Discard Pile**. This is where you will put cards when you have used them.

5. Give 1 player the P1 Marker.


Order of Play 
-----------

Repeat *Day Phase* and then *Night Phase* until either a player, or the bandits reach the end of their score track.

A complete *Day Phase* and *Night Phase* is called a **Round**.

### Day Phase

1. Draw Cards

    All players draw cards from their own personal deck until they have Cards in hand matching their hand size. (If they have more they do not have to discard)

    Whenever a Player needs to draw cards but his Draw Pile is empty, They shuffle their Discard Pile and it becomes their new Draw Deck. If the Discard pile is also empty, they do not draw any more.

2. Untap Player Card

    All players turn their Player Card to face forward (If it's not already)


3. Play and Buy Cards

    The player with the P1 Token takes one action. After him, all players in clockwise order take either 1 or 2 actions.

    Players continue taking 1 or 2 actions in clockwise order until all players have passed.

    The actions they may perform are as follows, and are explained in more detail later.

    * Perform a Job
    * Purchase a Card
    * Trade
    * Attack Bandits 
    * Pass

    Once a player has passed, they may not perform any more actions that round, but they may participate in other players actions.


*(In Solo and Co-op Games, just do actions the until you don't want to)*

4. May discard *Item Cards*.

    Players may discard as many Item cards as they wish. They may not discard any Danger cards at this point. *(Beware : If when you come to draw cards, you cannot draw at least 1 card, you lose)*

5. Pass the P1 Token *(In Solo Games ignore this)*

    The player who has the P1 Token passes it to the left.
### Night Phase

*(This is shown on the back of Player Cards)*

1. Move the Bandit Tracker

    One space on the score board.

2. Move the Trade Row

    1. Place the rightmost *Trade Row* card in the Trade row discard pile.
    2. Move all cards in the *Trade Row* 1 space right.
    3. Draw a Card from the draw pile and add it to the leftmost space on the *Trade Row*.

3. Everyone takes an Exhaustion Card.

    From the 'E' stack of Danger cards, draw, and give each player 1 card to place on the top of their Discard Pile *(Or Draw pile if they prefer)*

4. Bandits Attack
    
    Starting From West to East, Each Group of bandits on the same tile as a player Attack (See "Attacking")

5. Bandits Move.
    Starting from West, then North, For every group of bandits not in on the same tile as a player, roll the Compas Dice.
    Move the bandits 1 Space in the direction indicated. Or if you roll a '+' Add one Bandit to the group
    * Bandits may move onto tiles that have been placed but not revealed, but not onto places with no tile at all.
    * If they cannot move North or South, move them West instead.
    * If they cannot move West, add a Bandit.
    * If a group has 6 or more bandits do not add another.
    * If a group of bandits meets another group, that have not rolled yet, move the other group separately. If they do not separate, they become 1 bigger group.

6. Remove Tiles.

    Remove all tiles more than 5 complete spaces East of the Eastmost player, along with any Bandits on them.
    (This step is not strictly necessary, but those bandits are unlikely to affect the game any more).

7. Bandits Appear.

    Roll the chosen *Bandit Dice*, as many times as are indicated in the red star in the same section as the furthest forward player or bandit tracker on the scoreboard.
    For each roll, add 1 bandit to every tile with the same number in it's red star on the map.


Perform a Job
------------------

A Job is a set of Actions that must ALL be performed, they are indicated by a set of Icons in a row. For example.

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/job_examples.svg">

Jobs are found in 4 places.

* On Item Cards (Starter and Trade)

    To perform a Job on an Item Card, you must discard that card.
    You may only perform one job per card.

* On Danger Cards (Pain and Exhaustion)

    The reason to perform the Job on a Danger Card, is to get rid of it. Danger Cards may not be discarded like Item Cards, and so you have to use the last action of their Jobs to either Discard them or Scrap them.

    *(Note : Scrapping is much better as Discarding them means they will come into your hand again, Scrapping them means they are gone for good.)*

* On Player Cards

    To use a Job on a *Player Card* you must Tap that *Player Card*. That is rotate it by 90 degrees, to mark it as used. You may only use one job on a player card per round.  It will be Untapped again, at the start of each Round.

* On Village Tiles

    You may only use a Village's Job once per visit. To use it, your Meeple must be on that tile and standing up. Lay the Meeple down, and then do it's action.
    When you move out of that Village, stand your Meeple up again.

    **You cannot use a Village's job while there are Bandits on the tile**

If multiple jobs provide the same last action, you may use them in the same turn. Even if one of those jobs is a Card and the other on a Village or Player Card.

Understanding the Job Icons
----------------

### Places

Square Icons represent a place. Your Meeple must be in that kind of place to perform the action. There must also be **No Bandits on the tile**

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/places.svg">

### Resources

There are 4 key resources in the game, "Gold", "Iron", "Wood" and "Food". They can be paid and gained, to and from the General supply.

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/resources.svg">

'n' On the card will be an actual number.

The grey circles represent a group of 'n' of the same item.
If there are more than one grey circle, separate grey circles do not have to be the same resource.

### ⬢ Rolling Dice ⬢

The ⬢ Symbol means Roll Dice. The dice that come with this game have 6 sides, and the numbers [0,0,1,1,1,2] on representing successes.

If using standard D6, treat 3,4,5 as 1 Success, and 6 as 2 Successes.

If told "+n⬢" Roll 'n' dice and gain 1 of the resource for every success.

### 'x' Means Any Number

When Performing the Job If an action has an 'x' you can choose any number for x : Even Zero. It will be the same number for the whole Job.

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/x_is_any.svg">

### Card Acions

There are four actions that involve Cards

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/card_actions.svg">

When Scrapping a Card put it in the appropriate discard pile. eg 'E' Danger cards beside the 'E' Danger draw pile, Starter Cards are removed from the game.

Gained Cards can be added to top of your Draw Pile or Discard Pile

### Card Types

The four *Card Actions* can be applied to different types of cards. So the Card image will change to match the type.

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/card_action_types.svg">

When the card is "This card", the symbol will also match the color of the card to help you remember that it refers to the card you are looking at.

**You cannot discard a Danger Card when the action requires an Item Card Or Visa Versa**

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/card_action_examples.svg">

<h2 style="page-break-before:always">Build Railway</h2>

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/build_railway.svg">

* Place an Railway (Iron) Token on the Tile you are currently on.
* Cannot be done if there is already a Railway Token Down.
* Cannot be done if there are bandits on the tile.
* If this is the most West Railway yet, score 3 VP.
* Otherwise score 2 VP

## Reveal Land 

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/reveal.svg">

* Reveal 'n' tiles within 2 spaces from your current position. 
* One diagonal is allowed.
* You may choose places without a tile, add one and reveal it.

### Movement

These actions move your player 'n' spaces on the map orthagonaly (that is NWES and not diagonally). Though they have different limitations.


<img src="{{$0}}/rules/movement_normal.svg" style="float:left;margin:0px 20px 60px 0px">**Normal Movement**

* Cannot move onto water.
* Can move off of water.
* Moving onto a mountain counts as moving two spaces.
* Moving onto a tile with a railway does not cost movement points, but you must have at least 1 *Normal Movement* left. 

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/movement_climbing.svg" style="float:left;margin:0px 20px 60px 0px">**Climbing Movement**

* Cannot move onto water
* Can move off of water
* Mountains Cost 1 movement.
* Even tiles with railway cost 1 Movement

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/movement_sailing.svg" style="float:left;margin:0px 20px 60px 0px">**Sailing Movement**

* Must move either from or onto water or river.
* Moving onto a mountain costs 2 Spaces.
* Tiles with railway cost 1 Movement.
    
You may play multiple movement Jobs in the same turn and combine movement types in the same turn. *(Though as always, only play 1 Job per card)*

You may use any movement type to try to move onto unrevealed land.
If that turns out not enough, you may play another Job for the required movement, or not move there. Either way you score the VP for revealing it.

You do not have to move onto revealed land, however the attempt cost is 1 Distance (Any movement type). You may still use remaining movement to try another direction.

If you step onto a tile which is not yet revealed, reveal it. (See *Revealing Tiles*). If you step onto a space without a tile, add a tile, and then reveal it.

Bandits
-------

While travelling you are going to face bandits who will hinder your journey.They are represented by Bandit Counters.

When you reveal a Bandit Campfire, and during the Bandits Appear Phase, bandits will arrive on the map. They will mostly be travelling west, and if they meet you will attack you. You may attack them on your turn as well if you have the weapons to do it.

All Bandits on a tile are considered a group, and move and attack together.

### Attacking

Attacks work the same way whether Players or Bandits are attacking.
* Bandits have 1⬢ attack and 1⬢ defence for every bandit on the tile.
* Bandits take 'n' Damage by removing 'n' Bandits from the board.
* Players take 'n' damage by **all players** on the tile taking 'n' Pain cards each into their discard pile.

The order of a battle.

1. All players on the tile choose jobs they wish to activate, and pay their cost (But do not roll Attack or Defence with dice requirements yet)

Primary attack

2. The Attackers roll their attack for *hits*
3. Defenders their defence for *saves*
4. Defenders take 1 damage for every hit above saves.

Counter attack

5. Defenders roll their attack for *hits*
6. Attackers roll their defence for *saves*
7. Attackers take 1 damage for every hit above saves.

### Bandits Move

Starting with the Westmost (then Northmost) Group, for each group of bandits, Roll the Compas Dice, and Move them in the Direction Indicated *(N = North,W = West,S = South)*.
* If the dice lands on '+' Add a Bandit to the group. 
* If the group lands on a group that hasn't yet moved, move that group next. If the second group does not move, the two groups merge to become one larger group.
* Bandits may move onto unrevealed tiles, but not onto spaces without a tile.
* If the Bandits should move North or South but cannot, move them West.
* If the Bandits should move West but cannot, Add a Bandit (if less than 6)

### Bandits Appear

The "Bandit Risk" is the number in the red star in the scoreboard section with the furthest forward player or Bandit Tracker.

Roll the Bandit Dice, once per *Bandit Risk*, and add a bandit to all tiles with the rolled number in the red star on the tile.

*(The numbers on the tiles go from 1 to 8, so the d8 is the most likely to add bandits making the game harder)*

If after bandits appear, a group of bandits has 8 or more members, split the group as follows.

* Move 2 bandits in each of the four compas directions.
* If any direction is not possible, do not move those 2 bandits.
* Leave any others where they are.
* If this creates another group more than 8 ignore it. That can wait until the turn after.


Revealing Tiles
---------------

A key goal in Deck Goes West is to discover new land, ie reveal tiles. This is either done by moving or by the Reveal Action using Telescopes/Binoculars.

To reveal a tile, flip it faces up. And in standard mode score victory points (2 if furthest west or 1 otherwise).

If it has a Bandit Campfire, add a bandit to the tile, even if it already had bandits on it.

Once you have revealed the tile, add face down tiles to all empty spaces around it, except those East of the start tile.

** Note Adding these is important because bandits can appear and walk on these tiles **

## Cooperation Bonus

When a player performs a job with a last action that produces a Dice amount of a certain resource, if there are other players on the tile, he may invite them to join him.

The other players may then activate any of their jobs that also produce the same resource by dice, paying their appropriate cost.

All players then roll and gain the full amount they rolled, plus half of the amount the other players combined rolled (rounded up).

## Trade

When two players are on the same tile they may trade. The player who's turn it is offers the trade, and if it is agreed, **the active player discards an item card** and players proceed with the trade.

* Item Cards are traded from one players hand to the top of the other player's Draw or Discard pile.
* Resources are traded directly.
* Danger cards cannot be traded
* As part of the trade, one of the players may also move the other player using their own movement jobs. You may use either player's resources, but only one player may move
