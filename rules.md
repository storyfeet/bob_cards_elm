Deck Goes West - Rules
=============

Overview
--------

Set in the early settlement of the Americas, players compete, or work together, to travel West and complete a given mission. All while managing supplies, exhaustion and injuries, and staying safe from Bandits.

During the day phase of the game players play cards from their own deck to perform actions. They may also buy cards to gain abilities or perform their own character abilities.

During the night the bandits will take their turn, maybe even attack the players, and the trade row will upate.

Day follows night until the players either:

* Complete their mission / score track
* Run out of time
* Die of Exhaustion

Winning, Losing and Scoring
-------------------

The game is won by reaching the end of the score track first. 

The way you score points depends on the mission you are playing, but common ways are : 

1. Revealing Land Tiles
2. Building a Railway track
3. Removing bandits from an area
4. Moving Special pieces West
5. Feeding Villages

Players lose the game when the bandits reach the end of their score track, or when a character dies.

Character death:
* If a players hand **EVER** has as many danger cards as their hand limit that character dies and is out.
* Also at the end of the Night phase, if a player's hand has at least as many cards (of any kind) in their hand as their hand size at the end of the Bandit phase, that character dies.

    Note: This second rules means that you cannot refuse to discard playable cards to avoid drawing danger cards. But it allows you to keep weapons if there are bandits on your tile.



Verses, Co-op and Single player
---------------------

This game can be played as Verses, Co-op and Single Player. The rules barely need adjustment. Simply choose the appropriate *Mission Card* and everything basically falls into place.

For Verses Play:

* Each player has their own token on the score track.
* The first player to reach the end of the score track wins the game.
* Players take turns clockwise, starting with the holder of the P1 Token, which changes every day/round.
* If the Bandits reach the end of their track, the game ends immediately, and the player with the most points wins.

*(Ties are broken by distance west, followed by resource count)*

For Cooperative Play:

* Turn order is not important. Players may take their turns in any order they agree.
* All players share a single score counter, and as such, win or lose together.
* If any player dies, or the bandits reach the end of their track, the whole team lose.

For Solo Play:

* You play any the Co-op campaigns, managing two charaters with separate resource piles
* Turn order is not important.

Contents
---------

* Score Boards * 4
* Mission Cards * 12
* Crib Sheets * 4
* Meeples * 10 (2 Per player)
* Wagon * 2
* Travel Bar * 1
* Bandit Counters - small * 20 , big * 20
* Resource Counters - Wood, Food, Metal , Gold : small * 20 Big * 10

    * Compass Dice * 1: Dice with faces [N, S, W, W , W , + ]
    * Job Dice * 10: Dice with faces [0,0,1,1,1,2]

Setup
-----

First Separate the cards into 4 groups based on their top right corner:

* Yellow Star = Starter Cards
* Black Star 'P' = *Pain* Cards
* Black Star 'E' = *Exhaustion* Cards
* Anything Else = *Trade Row* cards

<img src="{{cat $0 "/rules/card_types.svg"}}" >

Note : Pain and Exhaustion are both types of "Danger Card" if your hand becomes full of them, you lose. 

### Board Setup

Choose a *Mission Card* appropriate for your group.

* If this is your first Verses game, use "Discovery"
* If this is your first Co-op game use "Speed of the Slowest"

Mission Cards look something like this:

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/mission_cards.svg">

On the back you will find:
* a game setup diagram 
* Mission specific setup instructions
* A set of checkboxes. To mark difficulty levels as complete.

On the front you will find:
* A mode (Vs, Coop )
* Mission Specific rules
* Icons showing you how you score in this game.    
(These are explained in the text above them)

Follow the instructions below, and those on the back of your Mission Card (Which have extra instructions for some campaigns) to setup the play area.

Use the following diagram to help you follow setup instructions

<img src="{{$0}}/setups/basic_setup_numbered.svg">

1. **Choose and Place Board:** Choose a direction to represent West on the table. Choose a Score Board from the options on the Mission Card. And place it to the east of the playing area.It's compass should show the directions intended, and there should be plenty of room to expand to the West.

2. Add a **Meeple** for every player to the golden '0' horseshoe on the *Score Board*. (In Coop add just one counter which the players share)

3. Add a **Bandit** to the red '0' horseshoe the *Score Board*, this will be the Bandit Tracker

4. Shuffle the **Trade Row** cards and deal 5 of them across the top of the Score Board. Leaving the rest in a draw pile beside them, with a space beside it for discards.

5. Shuffle the **Pain** and **Exhaustion** Cards separately and place them face down by the appropriate symbol on the score board. These will help you tell the piles apart as they have no markings on the back.

6. Shuffle the **Land Tiles** and deal 6 of them face up in a 2x3 grid. North to south should be 3 tiles.    
(Make sure to leave room to grow. As you move west more cards will be added here.)

7. Deal 7 more *Land Tiles*, face down around them, to the North, West and South.

8. Add a **Meeple** for each player to the Eastmost Central tile.    
(Even if it's Water)

9. Place the rest of the *Land Tiles* face down in a draw pile by the board.

10. Place the *Mission Card* beside the *scoreboard*.

11. Select a Bandit Dice and place it by the compass on the scoreboard. If this is your first game choose the D20, as this will spawn fewer bandits.    
*(In future games the D12, and D8 can be used to increase the game difficulty)*    
Place the Compass Dice (With faces N,S,W,W,W,+) next it.


### Player Setup 

<img src="{{cat $0 "/rules/player_setup.svg"}}">

1. Give each player a *Character Card* of the agreed **Difficulty**. <img src="{{$0}}/jobs/difficulty.svg" width="25px" height="25px"> (If this is your first game, choose 1).

2. Each player takes the **Resources** listed on the back of the *Character Card*

3. Each player takes the *Starter cards* listed on the back of the *Character Card*, shuffles them, and places them face down as their **Draw Pile** (It may be easier to sort the starter cards by name first)

4. Leave a space beside the *Character Card* for the **Discard Pile**. This is where you will put cards when you have used them.

5. Choose a player and give them the P1 Marker


Order of Play 
-----------

The Game is broken up into two phases : "Day Phase" and "Night Phase". During the Day, Players perform their actions. At Night, the board updates and the Bandits cause trouble.
The stages below are outlined in more detail below.

* Day Phase : Players -
    * Draw Cards
    * Untap Character Card
    * Player Actions
    * Discard Item Cards
    * Pass the P1 Token
* Night Phase
    * Move the Bandit Tracker
    * Move the Trade Row
    * Players takes an 'E' Danger Card
    * Bandits Attack
    * Bandits Move
    * Bandits Appear

Repeat *Day Phase* and then *Night Phase* until either a player, or the bandits reach the end of their score track.


### Day Phase

1. Draw Cards

    All players draw cards from their own personal deck until they have Cards in hand matching their hand size.

    Whenever a Player needs to draw cards but his Draw Pile is empty, They shuffle their Discard Pile and it becomes their new Draw Deck. If the Discard pile is also empty, they do not draw any more.

2. Untap Character Card

    All players turn their Character Card to face forward (If it's not already)


3. Player Actions

    The player with the P1 Token takes one action. After him, all players in clockwise order take either 1 or 2 actions.

    Players continue taking 1 or 2 actions in clockwise order until all players have passed.

    The actions they may perform are as follows, and are explained in more detail later.

    * Perform a Job 
    * Purchase a Card
    * Trade
    * Attack Bandits 
    * Pass

    Once a player has passed, they may not perform any more actions that round, but they may participate in other players actions.

*(In Solo and Co-op Games, just do actions the until you don't want to)*

4. May discard *Item Cards*.

    Players may discard as many Item cards as they wish. They may not discard any Danger cards at this point. *(Beware : If your hand is full at the end of night phase your character dies)*

5. Pass the P1 Token *(In Co-op and Solo Games ignore this)*

    The player who has the P1 Token passes it to the left.


### Night Phase

*(This is shown on the back of Character Cards)*

1. Move the Bandit Tracker

    One space on the score board.

2. Move the Trade Row

    1. Place the rightmost *Trade Row* card in the Trade row discard pile.
    2. Move all cards in the *Trade Row* 1 space right.
    3. Draw a Card from the draw pile and add it to the leftmost space on the *Trade Row*.

3. Everyone takes an Exhaustion Card.

    From the 'E' stack of Danger cards, to the top of their Discard Pile *(Or Draw pile if they prefer)*

4. Bandits Attack
    
    Starting From West to East, Each Group of bandits on the same tile as a player Attacks (See "Attacking")

5. Bandits Move.
    Starting from West, then North: For every group of bandits **not on the same tile as a player** and **not on a Bandit Camp**, roll the Compas Dice.
    Move the group 1 Space in the direction indicated. Or if you roll a '+' Add one Bandit to the group
    * Bandits may move onto face up or face down tiles, but not off the tiles.
    * If they cannot move in the rolled direction, move them in the opposite direction.
    * If they still cannot move, add a bandit
    * If a group of bandits meets group that have not yet moved, move, roll movement for the other group immediately. If the second group do not move, the two groups merge.

6. Remove Tiles.

    Remove all tiles more than 3 complete spaces East of the Eastmost player, along with any Bandits on them.
    (This step is not strictly necessary, but those bandits are unlikely to affect the game any more).

7. Bandits Appear.

    Roll the chosen *Bandit Dice*, as many times as are indicated in the red star in the same section as the furthest forward player or bandit tracker on the scoreboard.
    For each roll, add 1 bandit to every tile with the same number in it's red star on the map.

    If after bandits appear, a group of bandits has 6 or more members, split the group as follows.

    * Move 1 bandit in each of the four compas directions.
    * If any direction is not possible, do not move that bandit.
    * If this creates another group of at least 6 bandits do the same again.

Perform a Job
------------------

A Job is a set of **Steps**, each indicated by an Icon that must ALL be performed, they are indicated by a set of Icons in a row. For example.

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/job_examples.svg">

Jobs are found in 4 places.

* On Item Cards (Starter and Trade)

    To perform a Job on an Item Card, you must discard that card.
    You may only perform one job per card.

* On Danger Cards (Pain and Exhaustion)

    The reason to perform the Job on a Danger Card, is to get rid of it. Danger Cards may not be discarded like Item Cards, and so you have to use the last action of their Jobs to either Discard them or Scrap them.

    *(Note : Scrapping is much better than Discarding because the cards won't come back again)*

* On Character Cards

    To use a Job on a *Character Card* you must Tap it. That is rotate it by 90 degrees, to mark it as used. You may only use one job on it per round.  It will be Untapped again, at the start of each Round.

* On Tiles

    You may only use a Tile's Job once per visit. To use it, your Meeple must be on that tile and standing up. Lay the Meeple down, and then do the Tile action.
    When you move off of that Tile, stand your Meeple up again.

    **You cannot use a Tile's job while there are Bandits on it**

If multiple jobs have the same last Icon, you may use them in the same *Action*. Even if one the jobs are different places, (ie Cards, Players,Tiles)

You can also increase your reward for some jobs by working with other players. *(see Cooperation Bonus)*

Understanding the Job Icons
----------------

### Places

Square Icons represent a place. Your Meeple must be on that kind of tile, with no bandits on, to perform the action.

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/places.svg">

### Resources

There are 4 key resources in the game, "Gold", "Metal", "Wood" and "Food". They can be paid and gained, to and from the General supply.

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/resources.svg">

'n' On the card will be an actual number.

The grey circles represent a group of 'n' of the same item.
If there are more than one grey circle, separate grey circles do not have to be the same resource.

### ⬢ Rolling Dice ⬢

The ⬢ Symbol means Roll Dice. The dice that come with this game have 6 sides, and the numbers [0,0,1,1,1,2] on representing successes.

If using standard D6, treat 3,4,5 as 1 Success, and 6 as 2 Successes.

If told "+n⬢" Roll 'n' dice and gain 1 of the resource for every success.

### 'x' Means Any Number

When Performing the Job If an action has an 'x' you can choose any number for x : Even Zero. It will be the same number for the whole Job.

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/x_is_any.svg">

### Card Acions

There are four actions that involve Cards

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/card_actions.svg">

**Scrapping** a Card removes it from your deck completely so you do not see it again. Do not put in in your own discard pile, instead put it in the discard pile matching it's type. eg 'E' Danger cards beside the 'E' Danger draw pile. Starter Cards are removed from the game.

Whenever a player **Gains** a card, they may add it to the top of either their Draw Pile or their Discard Pile.

### Card Types

The four *Card Actions* can be applied to different types of cards. So the Card image will change to match the type.

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/card_action_types.svg">

When the card is "This card", the symbol will also match the color of the card to help you remember that it refers to the card you are looking at.

**You cannot discard a Danger Card when the action requires an Item Card Or Visa Versa**

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/card_action_examples.svg">

<h2 style="page-break-before:always">Build Railway</h2>

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/build_railway.svg">

* Place an Railway (Metal) Token on the Tile you are currently on.
* Cannot be done if there is already a Railway Token Down.
* Cannot be done if there are bandits on the tile.
* If this is the most West Railway yet, score 3 VP.
* Otherwise score 2 VP

## Reveal

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/reveal.svg">

* Reveal 'n' facedown tiles within 2 spaces from your current position. 
* One diagonal is allowed.
* You may complete each reveal before choosing the next.

### Movement

These actions move your player 'n' spaces on the map orthagonaly (that is NWES and not diagonally). Though they have different limitations.

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/movement_normal.svg" style="float:left;margin:0px 20px 60px 0px">**Normal Movement**

* Cannot move onto water.
* Can move off of water.
* Moving onto a mountain counts as moving two spaces.
* Moving onto a tile with a railway does not cost movement points, but you must have at least 1 *Normal Movement* left. 

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/movement_climbing.svg" style="float:left;margin:0px 20px 60px 0px">**Climbing Movement**

* Cannot move onto water
* Can move off of water
* Mountains Cost 1 movement.
* Even tiles with railway cost 1 Movement

<img src="{{$0}}/rules/movement_sailing.svg" style="float:left;margin:0px 20px 60px 0px">**Sailing Movement**

* Must move either from or onto water or river.
* Moving onto a mountain costs 2 Movement.
* Tiles with railway cost 1 Movement.
* May be combined with *Normal Movement* to move (from water/river) onto a Mountain.
    
You may play multiple movement Jobs in the same *action* and combine movement types. *(Though as always, only play 1 Job per card)*

You may use any movement type to try to move onto face down tiles revealing them as you move. 

If your movement does not match the tile, or is not enough to move onto it, you may play another Job to reach the required movement as part of the same action. Or you may choose not move there. Either way you score any VP for revealing it.

You do not have to move onto a tile after revealing it, however that reveal still costs one movement (of any type). You may still use remaining movement to try another direction.

Purchase a Card
-----------

The Cards on the *Trade Row* can be bought and added to your personal Deck. These increase your skills in the game.

Simply perform the job in the top corner of the card, and add it to the top of either your draw deck or discard pile.


Attacking and Defending
--------

Attacks work the same way whether Players or Bandits are attacking.
* Bandits have 1⬢ attack and 1⬢ defence for every bandit on the tile.
* Bandits take 'n' Damage by removing 'n' Bandits from the board.
* Players take 'n' damage by **all players** on the tile taking 'n' Pain cards each into their discard pile.

The order of a battle.

1. All players on the tile choose jobs they wish to activate, and pay their cost (But do not roll Attack or Defence with dice requirements yet)

Primary attack

2. The Attackers roll their attack for *hits*
3. Defenders their defence for *saves*
4. Defenders take 1 damage for every hit above saves.

Counter attack

5. Defenders roll their attack for *hits*
6. Attackers roll their defence for *saves*
7. Attackers take 1 damage for every hit above saves.



Revealing Tiles
---------------

A key goal in Deck Goes West is to discover new land, ie reveal tiles. This is either done by moving or by the Reveal Action using Telescopes/Binoculars.

To reveal a tile, flip it face up.
* If it has a Bandit Campfire, add a bandit to the tile, even if it already had bandits on it.
* Add a face down tile to all empty spaces around it, except those East of the Eastmost tile. 
* If there are no more tiles to reveal. Remove the Eastmost row on the board, and anything on them. Shuffle them to create a new Land Draw deck.
    * If a player is on a removed Tile, they take an Exhaustion Card and move West to the nearest tile.

## Cooperation Bonus

When a player performs a job with a last action that produces a Dice amount of a certain resource, if there are other players on the tile, he may invite them to join him.

The other players may then activate any of their jobs that also produce the same resource by dice, paying their appropriate cost.

All players then roll and gain the full amount they rolled, plus half of the amount the other players combined rolled (rounded up).

## Trade

When two players are on the same tile they may trade. The player who's turn it is offers the trade, and if it is agreed, **the active player discards an item card** and players proceed with the trade.

* Item Cards are traded from one players hand to the top of the other player's Draw or Discard pile.
* Resources are traded directly.
* Danger cards cannot be traded
* As part of the trade, players may combine their Movement Jobs and resources from both players to move ONE of the players. There is no limit on distance, if you come across unexpected obstacles, either player may add Movement Jobs to overcome them.
